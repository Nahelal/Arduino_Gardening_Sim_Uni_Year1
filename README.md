game design concept --> what is the interface gonna look like?? mini controller or unity scene to go alongside controller?
illustrate basic research into electronics and outline the requirements for components and physical factors for controller
analyse controller desing, how is it efefctive or flawed for use --> for example using the water sensor for the plant game, how is that reasonable and going to fit in with the rest of the controller?
list any electronic components of the controller that is going to be required
key things taking place in build

if goinng with the current idea, game is going to be a gardening sim mixed with the game 'bop-it' in order to create a fast pacead and exciting controller. there are going to be three seperate inputs, taking the form of a watering can, a sun, and bottle of plant nutrient. the way the game will work is to have a small plant pot or planter 3d printed or something (maybe add real soil on top or something like that?) and the three input sensors will have to interact with this in order to have the plant grow and the game progress. at the minute, this is going to be through motion sensors for the three objects that when moved as if to add to the plant, LEDs will light up on planter to signify that the input has been taken and is helping the plan, sort of like the sparkles in a game when you water a plant (atc, stardew valley or spirit farer) the order or want of these inputs will be decided by the game interface. this is going to be a simple 2d pixel art interface which will show the progress of the plant growing and then also show the input wanted by the controller and the player in order to make the plant grow more. to make the game more competative, the 'bop-it' aspect is going to play a part by making the game theoretically endless , leading to the game having a leaderboard for the players who manage to play for the longest. this will aslo slightly increase replayability as there will be a strive from players to get the highest score and beat the other previous players.
